## Recommend and summary for LLM model

If you don't want to see other,just get the answer here.

**For LLM,here just four which is recommendate for you**
**gpt-4o,gpt-4o-mini,o1**
**For easy task:gpt-4o-mini**
**For complex and reasoning task:o1**
**For common task:gpt-4o**
[And here is a guide from OpenAI to select model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-selection)

- gpt-4o
  The model has 128K context and an October 2023 knowledge cutoff
  Multimodal ![image-20241114160938801](img/image-20241114160938801.png)

- gpt-4o-mini
  Best cheap,even cheaper than GPT-3.5 Turbo
  The model has 128K context and an October 2023 knowledge cutoff
